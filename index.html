  <h2>What is the NYT Letter Boxed Game?</h2>

  <p>NYT Letter Boxed is a daily word puzzle game which is available on The New York Times Games. First time online to be played in 2019 and created by Sam Ezersky. It basically consists of 12 letters in English distributed across four sides of a square. To solve the puzzle, you must form words following a few simple but strict rules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Words must be at least three letters long.</li>
    <li>You cannot use two letters from the same side in a row.</li>
    <li>You must use all 12 letters at least once to solve the day’s puzzle.</li>
    <li>The next word must begin with the last letter of the previous word.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Although the puzzle may accept more than two words, a two-word solution is considered the best.</p>

  <h2>Why Strategy is Important</h2>

  <p>You might be thinking that the trial-and-error method is enough to solve the puzzle. But in the long run, consistent success in Letter Boxed relies on strategic thinking. Memorizing common word patterns, identifying rare letters early, and planning ahead for the word chain can save you time and increase your chances of finding two-word solutions.</p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Strategy to Solve Letter Boxed</h2>

  <h3>1. Analyze the Letter Distribution</h3>
  <p>Begin by scanning the 12 letters and identifying which letters are placed on each side of the square box. Group them into four sets of three. This will help you visualize potential word patterns without violating the same-side rule.</p>

  <h3>2. Identify Rare or Tricky Letters</h3>
  <p>Look for letters like Q, Z, X, or V, which are harder to include naturally in many words. Try to prioritize using these letters earlier, so you don’t struggle to fit them into your final solution.</p>

  <h3>3. Think About Common Prefixes and Suffixes</h3>
  <p>Use familiar word-building tools like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefixes: re-, un-, pre-, mis-, dis-</li>
    <li>Suffixes: -ing, -ly, -tion, -ment</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These help expand simple root words into longer and acceptable words.</p>

  <h3>4. Consider Word Chains</h3>
  <p>Every word must start with the last letter of the previous word. Try chaining words mentally. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>BOWERED</li>
    <li>DILUVIAN</li>
    <li>INDIVIDUAL</li>
    <li>LOWBRED</li>
    <li>INVULNERABLE</li>
    <li>ELBOWED</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Look for common word endings like E or D and match those to possible starting letters.</p>

  <h3>5. Reverse-Engineer Solutions</h3>
  <p>Sometimes it helps to start from the end. Pick a strong final word that uses uncommon letters and see what could logically connect to it. This back-solving method can also lead to unexpected but valid answers.</p>

  <h2>Common Patterns to Recognize</h2>

  <p>Some frequently used words are related to technology and science like bandwidth, calibrate, acid, material, YouTube, or exposure. These words often appear in puzzles. Additionally, words from nature or business like elephant, lion, oxygen, water, trees, management, operation, delivery also show up. These examples show how daily-life vocabulary is used creatively in the puzzle.</p>

  <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Using two letters from the same side (always double-check!).</li>
    <li>Using short words that prevent you from using all 12 letters.</li>
    <li>Skipping the difficult letters (like Q, X, or Z).</li>
    <li>Using non-English words like Spanish or Portuguese — only English words are allowed.</li>
  </ul>
